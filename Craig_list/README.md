Need the CraigsList metro/site.
Very difficult to deduce from the Business' city, as most cities do not have their own craigslist. Asking for the nearest major metro may work but even then its risky. Some Craigslist sites are for entire states, counties, while others are for specific cities. It is kind of random. I think the only reliable way to handle this is for businesses to provide the best Craigslist site. 

There is currently no input for the Ad, its all static information. Whenever this gets implemented we'll need to go back in and change the static information to the correct variables. 

The categories system will also be very difficult as the number of layers is dynamic. Some city/category combinations go 3-4 levels deep whil others are just 1 level. This is currently static.
